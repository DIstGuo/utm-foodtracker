**Team Capacity:** This sprint we decided to allocate 4-5 hours. This includes the meetings we have before the demo as well as meeting for the demo.

**Sprint goal**: For our last sprint we want to add any additional features necessary for the application such as having favorites, filtering through food based on certain tags, track the food users eat and to make our application come together we wanted all of the features we have implemented so far in all sprints to be usable on a mobile phone. We had a good idea on how to estimate every user story during Sprint 4 and did not stumble upon any spikes now.

1. In the previous sprint we allowed users to edit their budget and put the story requiring users to set their budget for this sprint so in order to implement NOR-12 we need to implement the font end feature as well as the route for communicating with the database.
2. We want users to pick and choose certain food to add to their favorites list to implement NOR-54. The front end component should allow users to add food items in a favorites list and have an API for storing and retrieving from the database and then displaying it.
3. We also want users to be able to see what they have eaten in a particular day or any time period. To implement user story NOR-6 we need to create a new collection in the database to have the userâ€™s intake history and set up the API and the front end component needed.
4. A user should also be able to search food based on tags so to implement user story NOR-22 we have to add the tags field to every food item in the database and then set up the API and front end component required.
5. After all the features are ready we want mobile users to have a UI that conforms to their mobile devices so they can use the web-app on the phone in order to satisfy NOR-21 requirements.
