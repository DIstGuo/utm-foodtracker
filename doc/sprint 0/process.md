# Process

**North-Building** uses Discord as a main way of communication. There are several text channels named as *General Discussion*, *Project*, *Announcements*, *Polls-and-Questions* and *Tools* to divide up topics of group discussion.

***Polls-and-Questions*** text channel contributes to our **decision making**. Decisions are based on choices from the majority of members. 

***Priority of user stories*** are often based on judgements of the team member who wrote that story. Objections will be raised if other team members do not agree. In that case, a further dicussion takes place to settle debate about priority of user stories. Basically, the priorities are setted based on structure, the user stories that would block the development of other user stories would be setted as highest priority.

***Meetings*** happen both in-person in tutorials and online through Discord. We had a meeting in campus, but most of the meetings are held online because they are more flexible. We can also insert votes into the discussion channel in Discord to allow more efficiency.

## Collaboration

*Google Docs* documents serve as drafts in which can be edited by all team members. We use these documents as storage of ideas. Ideas such as _the projects we are planning to deliver_ are put into Google Docs at the early stage.

User stories were written in Google Docs as a draft. Team lead was responsible for updating `Product Backlog`, another team member was responsible for putting user stories on JIRA. 

***Jobs/ deliverables*** are picked by each team member and are done individually, available jobs are listed in discord so everybody would pick one from the remaining jobs. Individual branch is created for each deliverable/ job. If one of the members meet a problem on the job, he/she would ask for help by discord so teammate can afford some helps. Final work will be first pushed onto individual branches. Members are asked to review merge requests for final merge. The job division for next step is also been decided, there would be 3 frontend,3 backend and 1 floater full stack developers in our team.

***Discussions*** are hold on discord in most of case. Team member can post and reply anytime and it doesn't require everybody online at same time.

***Votes*** are hold on google form, the opinion with the highest number of ticket would be selected as final decision. If there is a tie, further dicussion is involved or swapping a team member's choice would be a shortcut.

## Next Phase

We need to learn how to build the basic Web-apps. After that, we will focus on improving and subdividing user stories to benefit the project as a whole.

We will set more rules for discussion and organize polls and announcements effectively for better collaboration experience.
