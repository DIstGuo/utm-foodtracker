The team use discord as main way of communication. There are several channels named as general discussion, project, announcement, polls-and-questions and tools so we can discuss different topics in different channels.


  


We had a meeting in campus, but most of the meeting are hold online because they are more flexible. We can also insert votes into the discussion online to improve the efficiency.


  


We also made a google doc as a draft which can be edited by all team members. We use this document as a storage of ideas like what project we are planning to do. 


The user stories were written in this google doc as a draft. We also discussed about the ideas and put it into jira.


  


When there are many options, we will discuss about it and sometimes we vote to make the conclusion fair.


  


For the deliverables part, each of us picked a part to do individually. The final works would be push into different branches in github. Everything will be merged at end.






For the next step, we need to learn how to build the basic webapp. After that, we will focus on the user stories to improve the application.
