# Summary

## Primary objectives

Currently, students at the University of Toronto Mississauga campus feel like finding food options on campus that suit their budget and health needs is a hassle. The objective of this project is to build an app which aims to solve this problem by having the following objectives:

### Better Food Ordering Experience

**UTM Food Tracker** aims to provide students with the best food ordering experience by exposing necessary food and restaurant information in a clean User Interface. It allows students to accurately locate restaurants nearby; search and order food on-demand without wasting too much time.

### Personalized Data and Services

*Order History*, *Daily Digest*, *Budget Alignment* are unique to each user. UTM Food Tracker aims to provide users with personalized data and customized settings. These functionalities help students financially, as well as contributing to their healthy lifestyle.

### A Growing Food Community

Social Media is another big feature that serves the purpose of connecting users who love their food. The goal of the platform does not limit to food ordering itself, but also building relationship between users through "food".

## Key users

The key users that we have identified for our project are students, professors or visitors of the UTM campus. More specifically, students, professors or visitors who are new to the campus, or are health conscious about what they eat, or have specific budgets that they want to maintain for food, or want to know the length of lines and what has been sold out for specific restaraunts.
  
## Scenarios

1. Sara, a first year student at UTM, is not sure what she wants to eat and is not too familiar with the foods available at campus. She also gets frustrated by trying to find out the closing times and has a budget set of no more than $18. She can use our app to find out the closing times of the restaraunts and also use our Budget Alerts to keep track of her daily budget.

2. Whitney, a fourth year student at UTM, is very health conscious and has a very high passion for her fitness. She wants to eat healthy food and keep track of her calories. Currently she eats at the Northside Bistro in Deerfield, but is tired of eating there all the time. Whitney, can user our app to keep track of her calorie intake and browse through a variety of healthy food options on her phone.

3. Adam, a first year international student that lives at UTM residence, hates standing in a long line only to find out that the food he wanted is sold out. He is also a picky eater. Adam can use our app to find out if the food he wants is in supply, as well as, know what different cafetarias around campus have to offer. He believes this app will help him get more use out of the meal plan he paid for.

## Principles

### Reliable Information

Providing accurate information about food service and availability considered as one of the key principles. For example, user experience will suffer if a user finds out the food is gone right after he places an order and his credit card is being charged.

### Smooth UI

Keeping User Interface running as smoothly as possible is another key principle. Text and images over-cluttering the screen will degrade user experience as a whole.
