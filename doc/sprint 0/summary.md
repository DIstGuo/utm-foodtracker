# Summary

## Primary Objectives

The objective of this project is to help student search and order food online and on-demand with a better user experience. Moreover, to allow users to easily access their personal information such as, their budget (through Budget Alerts), order history, daily digest history or their favorite restaraunt and food. Another, primary objective of this app is to provide a top-notch user experience through fast-searches and neatly-organized restaraunt information and food prices. Finally, the last objective is to provide social networking on the app, where users can share posts about their favourite foods and can follow friends, as well as save money through "crowd ordering".

## Key users

The key users that we have identified for our project are students, professors or visitors to the UTM campus. More specifically, students, professors or visitors who are new to the campus, or health conscious about what they eat, or have specific budgets that they want to maintain for food, or want to know the length of lines and what has been sold out for specific restaraunts.
  
## Scenarios

1. Sara, a first year student at UTM, is not sure what she wants to eat and is not too familiar with the foods available at campus. She also gets frustrated by trying to find out the closing times and has a budget set of no more than $18. She can use our app to find out the closing times of the restaraunts and also use our Budget Alerts to keep track of her daily budget.

2. Whitney, a fourth year student at UTM, is very health conscious and has a very high passion for her fitness. She wants to eat healthy food and keep track of her calories. Currently she eats at the Northside Bistro in Deerfield, but is tired of eating there all the time. Whitney, can user our app to keep track of her calorie intake and browse through a variety of healthy food options on her phone.

3. Adam, a first year international student that lives at UTM residence, hates standing in a long line only to find out that the food he wanted is sold out. He is also a picky eater. Adam can use our app to find out if the food he wants is in supply, as well as, know what different cafetarias around campus have to offer. He believes this app will help him get more use out of the meal plan he paid for.

## Principles

The key principle is to provide information as accurate as possible, even if it means that the user might have to wait a few minutes for food related updates, such as but not limited to sudden promotions/sudden closures. 

Another key principle, is to provide the user the best user experience possible, not over-cluttering the screen, keeping things clean and simple.
