## About Competitor dineoncampus.ca/utm

This is the offical webpage for dineoncampus.ca for UTM. The webpage includes information about every food store on campus such as their dishes menu, location and hours of operation, promotions and their contact information. The webpage solely serves the purpose of providing information about dining on campus.

## Our Project is BETTER

**UTM Food Tracker** aims helping students to search and order food *online* and *on-demand* with a *better experience*.

### Easily Accesible Information

Each user has access to their personal data regarding budget, order history, daily digest history and favorite restaurant or food.

- *Budget Alert*: We target students who care about their wallets and build functions in this project to help them keeping track of food expense.

- A lot of students also care about their health and calories intake. Daily digest and data graphs are all they need to gain some health awareness.

### User Experience

keeps our project competitive with **fast-search** and **neatly-organized** restaurants information and food prices.

Imagine a scenario when a first-year undergraduate who does not familiar with campus restaurants wants to find some place to order food but don't know where. In this case, our project's built-in filter *Nearby Restaurants* would offer such a help. It will immediately shows relevant information about nearby restaurants on whatever smart device one has. Or better yet, this student can tap *order* and pick-up from the selected restaurant. Student can also keeps track of their order status and get notified when it is ready.

### Social Networking

Users who wants to connect with other people in the same community or share posts about their favorite foods now has a chance! Our project adopts social media profiles as a feature. Users can follow friends. They can toggle their accounts as public or private and much more.

**Crowd ordering** saves users money. Users are allowed to initiate an invite and form groups to share bills. This is better for people who wants to enjoy meal with their friends and not worrying about paying too much by themselves.

## Target Users

Although we keeps referring to "users" and "people" in this document. Really the target users are UTM students with different needs mentioned above.

## Why Competitors Lose Focus on Target Users

They aim to provide basic information about campus's dining structure. First, restaurant information are all over the place and lack organization. Second, they do not provide convenience to users of ordering food on-demand. This is a big disadvantage because students value their time. Third, it does not offer personalized experience like our project does. It does not have functionality such as *Budget Alert*, *Favorites*, and *Daily Digest*.
