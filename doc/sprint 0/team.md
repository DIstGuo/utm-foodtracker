# Guidelines
- Methods of Communications:
	utoronto email and discord.

- Communication response times:
	within 12 hours.

- Standup/other agile meetings:
	Meetings can happen online through discord or in person at school study rooms.

- Meeting prepartion:
	the only preparation needed is a smart device and a plan in mind.

- Version control:
	Content of log messages must follow industry standard (clear and concise). Commit modifications periodically to keep everyone updated. Whenever starting to modify code in branches, first check the status of git branches and see if there are any updates made by other team members recently. Always pull the updates first before working on the project.

- Roles and division of work:
	There will be a team coordinator who gather opinions and establish necessary documents for our agile team. Tasks will be claimed by team members once the project backlog is created.

- Submitting sprint deliverables and software:
	Deliverables should be submitted before the deadline of each sprint. Make sure that all the requirements and features are fulfilled and merged. Team coordinator is responsible to confirm the completion of deliverables and submit accordingly. Other team members also have the responsibility to notify team coordinator about any discrepancies in deliverables.

- Contingency planning:
	Evaluations on team members are being regularly conducted. A team member who does not cooperate will first be warned. Notice that team members' evaluation also contribute to the course mark. 

# Commit Guidelines
- You must **never** directly commit to the master branch.
- Commits should be done in their own feature branch which are then merged via pull request. 
-  When starting a new branch you must make sure the base branch is the up to date master branch.	
- A pull request should have at least one reviewer before it is merged into master. 
- Before beginning a pull request you must pull from master and make sure your branch compiles with the latest changes from master.
-  Commits should have helpful messages describing what is being changed in the commit.
	 Example good commit message:
	 `Fix: stop API from returning empty array when requesting data from 'x' endpoint`
