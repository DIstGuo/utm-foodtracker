Team Capacity: For this sprint we have decided that each person will give around 6-7 hours. This includes the hours for the times we meet as a group to work on a task and even what everyone does individually.

We started by figuring out the next step of the project: building the core functionality of the app. For this sprint most of our user stories were shared amongst 2-3 people as they involved work on the front end as well as the back end. Hence, we broke these into subtasks for the front end and the back end. 
We had a good idea on how to estimate every user story during Sprint 0 and did not stumble upon any spikes now.

**Sprint goal:** We want users to login and be able to view the different restaurants located on campus and view basic information along with at least some menu information.
We also want users to be able to set their user profile information. 

1. To get started with user story NOR-17 which was the last building block for setting the foundation of our application we must set up the API skeleton for the data query and have the need routings set up.
2. To present information about restaurants to the user and implementing user story NOR-44 we want to implement a basic homepage template (nothing too fancy for now) and retrieve some information from the server regarding the restaurants.
3. Now that users can view the different restaurants located on campus we want them to be able to view the menus/price so we need to implement NOR-11 and NOR-2. We will be able to retrieve this information from the mongoDB database using an API.
4. Users must be able to log in so in order to get started with user story NOR-37 we must have a login authentication API set up and also a template for the registration portal
5. In order for a user to set up basic information about themself and view a user profile containing their name, profile picture and email address we must set up an API for viewing and retrieving user information
