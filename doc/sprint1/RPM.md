**Participants**: Rongda Yu, Mingshen Zhu, Salwa Abdul Qayyum, Joshua Fernandes, Bo Liu, ShiZhen Cui, Taha Kazi

**Release Date**: April 3rd

**Major features we intend to release:**
1. Users should be able to view information about the different food vendors located on campus, the nutritional information of the food they consume on campus while adhering to a budget.
2. Users should be able to have a platform where they can engage with other students on campus and share opinions on topics such as food on campus, daily diet, health tips etc.
3. Users should be able to order food for takeaways and should have the option of ordering in a group so they can split up food costs.

How we plan to divide these features is by completing 5 user stories totalling up to at least 30-40 points every sprint while focusing on the higher priority user stories first before working on the lower priority once. If we feel that we have time even after implementing all the lower priority features we can think of some additional minor features to be implemented.

**Sprint 0** was about setting the tone for our project and has brought clarity to everyone in terms of what we have to accomplish for the application.

**Sprint 1** is about setting the foundation needed to build all the major features described above. Everyone is made familiar with the aspects they will work on such as front end frameworks and databases.

**Sprint 2**: We plan to make information about the food and restaurants actually visible on the application. We want all the components that we set up in Sprint 1 to actually work together in harmony to render the needed information. There will be a lot of personalization involved in this sprint and a lot of work on the front end, so some tasks may spill over to the third sprint.

**Sprint 3**: Now that a user can log in to our platform and have all the information they need to make mindful decisions about the food they want to get on campus we want them to be able to communicate with other users. We also want users to be able to get daily budget alerts if they exceed their budget and also allow users to store their favorite food items.

**Sprint 4**: If we have time on our hands we will implement additional features such as for students to have the option to be delivered food across campus by other students. Also, we would prefer to obtain data on our app updated automatically. We aim to get simple menu information in Sprint 1 or 2 but in Sprint 4, if we do have the time we will work on how to update it in case the menu and hours of operation change in situations such as reading week/exam periods.
