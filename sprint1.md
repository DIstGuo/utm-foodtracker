**Team Capacity**: 7

**Participants**: Rongda Yu, Mingshen Zhu, Salwa Abdul Qayyum, Joshua Fernandes, Bo Liu, ShiZhen Cui, Taha Kazi

We started by first distributing a user story to every person, went over how each user story will be broken down into tasks. We decided to let the asignees decide how they wanted to break down the user story in the tasks. Every participant has participated by seeking out a user story they would be comfortable working on and if they weren't comfortable, we actively came with resources to direct each other to the necessary source of information needed to complete a specific user story

**Sprint goal**: To have a general application ready so we can have a foundation ready to build all the needed features we will be working on in Sprint 2.

By the end of the sprint we plan to have the following features completed with the associated user stories satisfied:

1. For getting started with user story, NOR-16 and NOR-17, we will set up the application boilerplate by installing Webkit tools and creating a TSLint file. We will then create angular components along with implementing the routing needed. In case we dont have all data and the connections set up, we will use stub data until we have everything connected.
2. For the daily digest history for user story NOR-7 we plan to have at least component boxes set up so we can have a general idea of what will go in those boxes. 
4. To complete NOR-3, we plan to have a log in portal ready for the users using a basic login template and a login authentication through an API service.
5. For setting up a database we can connect to to satisfy user story NOR-19 we decided to use MongoDB and will look into how to start a cluster on mlabs so our database will be on the cloud
